# Description
This project explores the Amazon review dataset([https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/)).

# Tasks
Our primary objective is to analyze products based on customer reviews and overall popularity. This analysis is divided into three key subcategories:

    1. Predicting Product Ratings  
    2. Price vs Rating Analysis  
    3. Product Popularity Analysis

These tasks are evaluated in three separate Jupyter Notebooks outlined in the **Files** section. 

# Files in the Repository
    1. predicting_product_ratings.ipynb  
    2. Price_rating_analysis.ipynb  
    3. Product_popularity_analysis.ipynb   
    4. README.md  
Because the data doesn’t fit for Github uploads, please visit the Github link in the **Description** section to download the data used in this analysis.   
Not included in this zip but required to run project files:  
    5. All_Beauty.jsonl  
    6. meta_All_Beauty.jsonl  
    7. Beauty_and_Personal_Care.jsonl  
    8. meta_Beauty_and_Personal_Care.jsonl

# To run the notebooks
    1. Open the three \*.ipynb files in your preferred environment.  
    2. Install any dependencies \- Install all required libraries as mentioned at the beginning of the notebook (if they’re already not installed).  
    3. Prepare the data.   
	(i) Go to the Github link from the **Description** section  
	(ii) Under “Grouped by Category” there are download links for the All\_Beauty and Beauty\_and\_Personal\_Care categories for their review data and metadata.  
	(iii) Download the data according to the .jsonl files list outlined in the Files section.   
    4. Load the dataset \- Update the file paths in the Jupyter Notebooks to point to the location of your data files.  
    5. Run the notebook \- Execute the notebook cells sequentially to run the analysis.
