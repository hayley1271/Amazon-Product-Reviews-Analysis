Description: This notebook explores the Amazon review dataset([https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/)).

Tasks: Our primary objective is to analyze products based on customer reviews and overall popularity. This analysis is divided into three key subcategories:

1. Predicting Product Ratings  
2. Price vs Rating Analysis  
3. Product Popularity Analysis

These tasks are evaluated in three separate Jupyter Notebooks outlined in the Files section. 

Files in the Repository:  
    1\. predicting\_product\_ratings.ipynb  
    2\. Price\_rating\_analysis.ipynb  
    3\. Product\_popularity\_analysis.ipynb   
    4\. README  
Because the data doesn’t fit in the zip folder for Gradescope submissions, please visit the github link in the Description section to download the data used in the final project.   
Not included in this zip but required to run project files:  
    5\. All\_Beauty.jsonl  
    6\. meta\_All\_Beauty.jsonl  
    7\. Beauty\_and\_Personal\_Care.jsonl  
    8\. meta\_Beauty\_and\_Personal\_Care.jsonl

To read the python file:  
1\. Open the three \*.ipynb files in your preferred environment.  
2\. Install any dependencies \- Install all required libraries as mentioned at the beginning of the notebook (if they’re already not installed).  
3\. Prepare the data.   
	(i) Go to the Github link from the Description section  
	(ii) Under “Grouped by Category” there are download links for the All\_Beauty and Beauty\_and\_Personal\_Care categories for their review data and metadata.  
	(iii) Download the data according to the .jsonl files list outlined in the Files section.   
4\. Load the dataset \- Update the file paths in the Jupyter Notebooks to point to the location of your data files.  
5\. Run the notebook \- Execute the notebook cells sequentially to run the analysis.
